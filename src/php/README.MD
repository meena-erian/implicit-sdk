# implicit SDK / PHP

To use the implicit SDK on a PHP based server-side, just import the class [**ImplicitEndpoint**](/lib/implicit_endpoint.php) and create your API endpoint as a class that extends the **ImplicitEndpoint** class and then initiate a new instance of that class.

See the examples folder for more information.
